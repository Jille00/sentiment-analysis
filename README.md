\section{Abstract}
Sentiment analysis is one of the most important aspects of natural language processing (NLP). Its usage varies a lot, from customer service to personal assistants. The aim of sentiment analysis is to understand what emotion the user is trying to express. In this research we compared three algorithms and their performance in categorizing movie reviews as either a positive or negative sentiment. The goal was to find the best model and in which areas they excel. We created a recurrent neural network, a na√Øve Bayes classifier and a random forest. All three models were tested on accuracy, training time, sample time and storage space. The accuracy of all three models was quite similar but they differed a lot in the other metrics. The conclusion is that each model has a specific application area which is determined by how the user plans on using the model.
